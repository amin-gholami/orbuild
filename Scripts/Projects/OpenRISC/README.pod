This is the source file from which the README file is generated.

This file is written in Perl's Plain Old Documentation (POD) format.
Run the following Perl commands to convert it to text or to HTML
for easy reading:

  podchecker README.pod  # Optional, check syntax.
  pod2text README.pod >README.txt

  # pod2html seems buggy, at least in perl v5.10.1, therefore
  # I'm using this long one-liner instead (with bash):
  perl -MPod::Simple::HTML  -e "\$p = Pod::Simple::HTML->new; \$p->index( 1 ); \$p->output_fh( *STDOUT{IO} ); \$p->force_title('orbuild OpenRISC project'); \$p->parse_file('README.pod');"  >README.html

This file is best edited with emacs module pod-mode, available in CPAN.
However, the POD syntax is quite simple and can be edited with a standard text editor.

=head1 OpenRISC I<< orbuild >> project

This is what the project currently downloads, builds and tests:

=over

=item * OpenRISC repositories

A collection of repositories often used together with OpenRISC designs,
they are mostly Subversion repositories from L<< http://OpenCores.org/ >> .

=item * Icarus Verilog

Taken from git L<< git://github.com/steveicarus/iverilog.git >> , stable branch I<< v0_9-branch >> ,
so it may not be as stable as an officially-released version.

This step is not strictly necessary, an officially-released version will also do.

=item * Verilator

Taken from git head at L<< http://git.veripool.org/git/verilator >> , so it may not be as stable
as an officially-released version.

This step is not strictly necessary, an officially-released version will also do.

=item * OpenRISC Toolchain

This includes the I<< or1ksim >> simulator, Binutils, Newlib, GCC and GDB. Some of the self-tests are also run after building.

Most of those components are installed together in a combined I<< ToolchainOr32 >> subdirectory.

=item * ORPSoC v2

The I<< rtl-tests >> are run. The PDF documentation is also built.
